# AirBnB Clone

Welcome to the AirBnB clone project! This project is a simplified version of the AirBnB web application, focusing on backend development and command-line interface (CLI) management.

## Project Overview

This project involves building a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. The main goal is to create a robust backend for an AirBnB-like service, which includes the following key features:

- Create, update, delete, and manage different objects such as users, places, and states.
- Serialize and deserialize objects to and from JSON format.
- Store and retrieve objects from a file.

## Features

- **Command Interpreter:** A CLI tool to interact with the backend.
- **BaseModel Class:** A parent class that handles initialization, serialization, and deserialization.
- **File Storage:** A simple file-based storage engine to save and load objects.
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive tests to ensure the correctness of the code.

## Getting Started
